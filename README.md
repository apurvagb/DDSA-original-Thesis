#DDSA-ARGoS

This is a fork of the iAnt-ARGoS code. It contains the DDSA (Distributed Deterministic Spider Algorithm).

To install ARGoS follow the instructions here: http://www.argos-sim.info

Compile the DDSA simulation by running the build.sh script in the root directory of the repository.

A video of the DDSA running can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lloXmwfT4aE

Changes in the DDSA code for comparing its comparison to PPCA-CCPFA approach:

1. Nest radius changed to 4 cm
2. Robot rotation Speed changed to 10 cm/s
3. Ticks per second changed to 48
4. Change the cluster position by changing the coordinates for paramaeter "ClusterPosition"

The configuration parameters can be changed in the experiment file : DDSA.xml

Compile the DDSA simulation by running the build.sh script in the root directory of the repository.
Run the code using ./run.sh
